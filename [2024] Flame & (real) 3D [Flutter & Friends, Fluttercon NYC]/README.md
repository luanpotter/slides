# Flame & (real) 3D

This is a follow-up to my previous talk "Flame & (pseudo) 3D" in which we explore how to use the new Flutter GPU package to leverage the "real" GPU-powered 3d-world rendering within Flame.

Checkout [Defend the Donut](https://github.com/flame-engine/defend_the_donut/) and [Collect the Donut](github.com/luanpotter/collect_the_donut), the sample games I built to showcase the concepts in the talk. They can serve as a base for starting off your 3D journey.

This is a simple showcase of Collect the Donut:

## Slides

I gave this talk twice, first at Flutter & Friends and then at Fluttercon NYC. In the interest of time, I had to cut some slides, and I ended-up making different choices for each talk. So below you can find PDF versions as seen at each event, plus a "Ultimate Cut" version with all slides.

* [Fluttercon NYC](2024-fluttercon-nyc.pdf)
